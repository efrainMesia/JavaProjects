# JavaProjects

I learnt Java in Open University of Israel. The following projects below displays my assignments during this course.


1. Conway's lifecycle - 
   I applied Conway's research of organisms lifecycle for my first assignment. This helped further my understanding of Graphic User Interface (GUI).
In the beginning of the program you will see an empty matrix. However, each cells will eventually represent an organism. Once the next generation button is pressed the program will then set a random matrix containing organisms. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life
   
   There is three ways that an organism develops:
   
        Creation - On each empty cell there is exactly 3 filled cells, so in the next generation will create a new organism (filled cell)
        Death - Each filled cell which has 0 or 1 filled neighbor, will convert to empty. also each filled cell that has more than 4 filled cell will convert to empty.
        Existency - Each filled cell that has 2 or 3 filled neighbors will continue be filled.

2. PhoneBook:
   As normal phonebook application, we are able to save phonebook, remove contacts, load phonebook.
   Load and save phonebook was done using Serialize. we can search phones by names or phones.
   Its possible to update contacts and also add contacts.
   This assignment helped me to understand how to implement Interfaces and also how to use Generics Classes.

3. Server and Client:
   Clients has canvas to draw rectangles on. The clients connect to the server and send the rectangle that has been drawed, and the server draw the rectangle on it's own canvas.
   If the clients clear the canvas, it doesnt send that to the server. Only the server can clear its own canvas.
